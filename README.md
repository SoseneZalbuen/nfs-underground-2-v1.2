ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ ***It is recommended that you back up all game files prior to this mod's installation so you can easily go back to the vanilla/unmodified version, should you face any issues***

___

+  Make sure your copy of Underground 2 is updated to Version 1.2.

+  Once that's ready, copy and paste the contents of the 'Need for Speed Underground 2' folder into where you have Underground 2 installed
(default directory: "C:\Program Files (x86)\EA GAMES\Need for Speed Underground 2")

+  You can quickly get to this by right-clicking on the UG2 shortcut on your desktop and selecting 'Open file location'

+  Make sure to override all pre-existing files

+  You'll then have to apply the US NFSU2 1.2 no-CD Patch created by HOODLUM. A no-CD patch is required to make the game work on Windows 10 but this specific one by HOODLUM is needed as it allows the Visual Rep fix by thelink2012 to function

+  If you aren't able to find it then, as a last resort, you can play NGX without the Visual Rep Remover mod by going into your 'scripts' folder and removing the 'novisualrep.asi' file from that folder
